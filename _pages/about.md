I am a group leader at the Faculty of Physics at the [University-Duisburg-Essen](https://www.uni-due.de), Germany running a group with focus on ["Computational Science of Interfaces"](https://www.uni-due.de/physik/stein/). For five years we are supported by a return fellowship from the state of North-Rhine Westphalia. We are further associated with the [RESOLV](https://www.solvation.de) cluster of excellence and the graduate school on ["Confinement-Controlled Chemistry"](http://www.confinement-controlled-chemistry.de).

Before, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the group of [Prof. Martin Head-Gordon](https://mhggroupberkeley.com) at the University of California at Berkeley.
In my main project, I developed grand-canonical electronic structure methods for electrocatalysis.
Side projects cover a range of topics such as *strong correlation*, *machine learning*, *magnetic coupling in inorganic complexes* and *kinetics of gas-phase reactions*.

Before I came to Berkeley I did my PhD in theoretical chemistry in the group of [Prof. Markus Reiher](http://www.reiher.ethz.ch) at ETH Zürich.
There, I developed automated methods for the crucial active orbital space selection in multi-configurational calculations.
This automated procedure relies on orbital entanglement measures obtained from partially converged density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations.
In a second project, I extended our QCMaquis DMRG program for the calculation of vibrational wave functions together with Dr. Alberto Baiardi.

I studied chemistry at the University of Göttingen from 2009 to 2014.
From 2013, I worked as a student researcher in the group of the late Prof. Peter Botschwina.
In several projects, we calculated rovibrational spectra of small, linear molecules with sub-wavenumber precision.
