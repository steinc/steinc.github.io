I am a postdoctoral researcher in the group of [Prof. Martin Head-Gordon](https://mhggroupberkeley.com) at the University of California at Berkeley.
In my main project, I develop grand-canonical electronic structure methods for electrocatalysis.
Side projects cover a range of topics such as *strong correlation*, *machine learning*, *magnetic coupling in inorganic complexes* and *kinetics of gas-phase reactions*.
I will present details on all of these projects once they are ready for publication.

Before I came to Berkeley I did my PhD in theoretical chemistry in the group of [Prof. Markus Reiher](http://www.reiher.ethz.ch) at ETH Zürich.
There, I developed automated methods for the crucial active orbital space selection in multi-configurational calculations.
This automated procedure relies on orbital entanglement measures obtained from partially converged density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations.
In a second project, I extended our QCMaquis DMRG program for the calculation of vibrational wave functions together with Dr. Alberto Baiardi.

I studied chemistry at the University of Göttingen from 2009 to 2014.
From 2013, I worked as a student researcher in the group of the late Prof. Peter Botschwina.
In several projects, we calculated rovibrational spectra of small, linear molecules with sub-wavenumber precision.
