### Catalysis
As chemistry is the science of matter and its transformations, the identification of processes that allow to convert abundant substances into a desired product at low cost and hence high efficiency is of utmost importance to the chemical industry.
Catalytic processes enhance the selectivity of a reaction and lower the barrier so that reactions can be carried out under milder conditions.
Therefore, a detailed understanding of catalysis is of major interest for both fundamental research and industrial process optimization and is an interdisciplinary field that requires a plethora of methods and expertise.
