[Our paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscatal.8b00286) on an iodine catalyzed intramolecular C-H amination of alkyl groups via amidyl radicals is accepted for publication with ACS Catalyis. Together with the organic chemistry group of Prof. Kilian Muniz in Tarragona we analyzed a proposed catalytic cycle with DFT calculations. The synthetic protocol is a considerable extension of the [protocol we presented last year](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ange.201703611), because the terminal iodine(III) oxidant is now required only in catalytic amounts since it is reoxidized with mCPBA.
<p>Many thanks to Prof. Kilian Muniz and his group for the great collaboration!</p>
