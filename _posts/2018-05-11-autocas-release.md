We released the [autoCAS](https://scine.ethz.ch/download/autocas) program for the automated selection of active orbital spaces for multi-configurational calculations. This program combines one part of my PhD research and allows non-experts to carry out multi-configurational calculations. It is available for macOS and Linux systems and interfaces the electronic structure program OpenMolcas and the QCMaquis density matrix renormalization group program of the Reiher group.
<p>Have fun with autoCAS!</p>
