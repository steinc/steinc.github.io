I finally found some time to add a number of my most recent publications, talks and posters.
I am especially happy, proud and humbled to announce that my PhD thesis was awarded with the ETH medal for outstanding PhD theses. For work carried out at UC Berkeley during my postdoc I was recently awarded the ACS Comp Section / Wiley Computers in Chemistry Outstanding Postdoc Award. Unfortunately, due to the COVID-19 situation, the ACS National Meeting in Philadelphia was cancelled and I was not able to receive that award in person.

This year I will publish some more of my postdoctoral work on electrocatalysis as well as some very exciting work done in collaboration with experimental groups from Bochum and GÃ¶ttingen. Furthermore, we are close to finishing some work I did with very talented PhD students here in Berkeley and most likely some machine-learning applications. Stay tuned!
