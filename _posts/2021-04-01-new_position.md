Last year I was awarded an NRW Return Fellowship that supports me in starting my own group over a period of 5 years with 1.25 Mio. Euro. 
I am more than happy to announce that today I started my independent research group on ["Computational Science of Interfaces"](https://www.uni-due.de/physik/stein/) at the University Duisburg-Essen.
We will be further connected to the [RESOLV](www.solvation.de) cluster of excellence. Please check this website or my official website (link above) for openings of PhD or postdoc positions.
