# About Me
TESTTESTTEST

My name is Gregor Simm and I am a Ph.D. student in theoretical chemistry in the group of [Markus Reiher](http://www.reiher.ethz.ch/) at ETH Zurich.

By applying Bayesian statistics and machine learning (especially Gaussian processes) I am looking for efficient quantum chemical methods with error estimation capabilities.
In addition, I am interested in the development of tools for the automatic exploration of complex chemical reaction networks.
Check out my [publications]({{ site.url }}/publications) for more information.

I completed by BSc. and MSc. at ETH Zurich in natural sciences (Focus: Chemistry and Physics).
I carried my master's project in the group of [Al√°n Aspuru-Guzik](http://aspuru.chem.harvard.edu/) at Harvard University, where I applied Gaussian processes to accelerate the discovery of efficient organic photovoltaics.
